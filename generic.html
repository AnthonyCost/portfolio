										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>Ever since I can remember, I have been a geek for computers. It began when I started playing videogames on a supernintendo emulator on the family computer when I was around four years old. My brother and I would spend hours attached to it, messing around with settings to see what it would do to the state of the game whether it was cheat codes or finding simple hidden easter eggs. Another passion I've had since a young age was creating things, whether it was doodling on a notepad or building a fort out of pillows, you can bet my little brain was amazed with the "wonders" I made.</p>

Instead of having that weigh on me, I adapted to the changes that life threw my way. To this day, it is the one of the few things I'm eternally grateful for, experiencing different lifestyles with all manner of folk. I made some friends for a short time and plenty of friends for life. And through the power of the internet and technology itself, regardless of where I was travelling to I can always keep in touch with them. And that was the constant with moving besides my family and the connections I made, my trusty computer. </p>

And with that diploma, I was initially going to follow my passion for art by becoming a graphic designer. Yet, just as life has done for me and many others, I was thrown a curve ball. After plenty of soul searching and pondering, I came to the conclusion to follow my first passion, my one true constant, the peanut butter to my jelly; creativity and technology. After studying and practicing freelance development with my younger brother, I knew it was the right move for me to become a software developer. We worked with clients and made their visions of what they wanted their sites to look like a reality.</p>
									<p>Once I thought I was in a groove, the world itself suddenly came to a halt as a global pandemic hit. With being quarantined and left with the thoughts in my head, I figured I could make lemonade out of the lemon that life had given all of us. So I further pursued my studies at App Academy. App Academy not only taught me a lot of software engineering, but also gave me the chance to make more friends for life. Not only was it an experience to see myself grow as an engineer, but my fellow colleagues. To think that we started writing a console.log of "Hello World!" to building full stack apps from scratch in the span of six months still boggles my mind. And now, the next chapter of my journey remains open. I am excited to see where life takes me next and the people I'll meet along the way! </p>
